# cl-czmq3 - A re-binding of the C binding for the zmq transport layer (czmq) #

**Under development, not yet for end-users**

## Overview ##

cl-czmq is a lisp binding for the [CZMQ C
binding](http://czmq.zeromq.org/) for the [ZMQ transport
layer](http://zeromq.org/).

ZMQ is an extremely useful socket and messaging layer which makes
network programming not just possible, but fun. [Read the
Guide!](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all)

Why CZMQ and not ZMQ?

- Target multiple zmq versions through CZMQ.
- CZMQ is cleaner to implement. There's no need to build an arbitrary
  additional API on top of it - unlike zmq. This means a straight port
  is actually usable.
- A straight port makes it easier to translate between C and lisp for
  e.g. guide examples and documentation.
- CZMQ contains cool constructs such as zbeacon, zloop, zmsg, etc.
- CZMQ is in C not C++ :-)

## Installation ##

Build zmq and czmq in your platform specific way.

We suggest using [quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org). Install that,
and then grab the cl-czmq source (via tarball or git) and put it in
`~/quicklisp/local-projects/`. Symlinks work okay too.

## Compatibility ##

Tested:
- zmq 3.2.3
- czmq 1.4.1
- sbcl 1.1.7+ on Linux and Mac OSX 10.8.2
- Franz Allegro Common Lisp 8.1
  - `zclock_time` doesn't work due to :long-long usage. This may be 32 bit only.  There's a replacement native implementation of `zclock-sleep`.
  - Polls don't work correctly due to the threading architecture of Franz ACL. For example, czmq's `zclock_sleep` always returns immediately
  - `zmq_poll` (and hence `zpollset_poll` returns immediately with `ZMQ_POLLERR` if you set a time greater than 0.
  - recvs and polls - even in the foreground thread - are interrupted often.

## Documentation and Examples ##

See the czmq(7) manpage. Also see czmq.zeromq.com.

A work-in-process port of the examples in the [ZMQ
guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all) is at
https://github.com/lhope/zguide/tree/master/examples/cl-czmq
. Currently all examples through Chapter 3 are done. The Pirate
examples of Chapter 4 are all done, too.


## Scope and Goals ##

The scope of cl-czmq is to provide CZMQ's functionality to Lisp. CZMQ
provides easy functions to send and receive memory blocks, strings,
message frames, and multi-part messages. It simplifies greatly the ZMQ
socket options.

Some functionality of CZMQ is not ported. Fore example, Zero copy methods are
pointless, since we have to copy data into C anyway.

Most cl-czmq functions are thin wrappers around CZMQ. zloop, zhash,
zlist and zthread are, however, lisp re-implementations.

A minimum of extra functionality is introduced. See **Using cl-czmq**
below.

The goal is to track a well-used API which provides solid
interoperability with primitive Lisp types. Experience shows that a
"Lispy" CLOS system can be beautiful to some and a hindrance to
others.  Others are free to layer their own API if they like.

## Using cl-czmq ##

cl-czmq is more or less a straight port of czmq. This means the CZMQ
documentation straightforwardly applies. We have, however, made some
changes to facilitate lisp programming style.

- Code is available in the package named `:cl-czmq` (nicknamed `:czmq`).

- Names are dashed instead of underscored. e.g. `zsocket-create`
  instead of `zsocket_create`.

- Constants are in lisp idiomatic style. e.g. `+czmq-version-major+` instead of
  CZMQ_VERSION_MAJOR.

- Where a CZMQ function would return a failure signal, cl-czmq returns
  nil instead. e.g. `NULL` for a pointer or `rc = -1` becomes nil.

- Where a destructor would take a reference and set the destroyed
  variable to `NULL`, we instead return the value, which would be nil
  if the destruction was successful.

- We have introduced a set of `zpollset` functions. These manipulate
  `zmg_pollitem_t` arrays for polling and zloop.

- We have included helper functions and macros to create callback
  functions for zloop. See **zloop and polling** below.

- We have included the common `with-` idiom for some of the
  classes. e.g. `with-zctx`, `with-zsocket`, etc... these take care of
  binding, creating and releasing the underlying blocks of memory.

## polling and zloop ##

The one place CZMQ is lacking is that it does not provide a polling
class of its own. It uses ZMQ's zmq_pollitem_t. To make up for this,
we have implemented a zpollset class using the same style as CZMQ. See
`src/zpollset.lisp` for documentation. We also provide `zpollset-poll`
which is a direct api into `zmq_poll`.

zloop is a an [event
reactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern) which uses
handler functions to deal with events.

Unlike the rest of cl-czmq, zloop has been ported to CL. This is so it
can support full lisp closures and lisp objects.  Handler functions
take the zloop and triggering pollitem (or nil for timers) as the
first two values, with the rest of the arguments as passed through
`zloop-poller` and/or `zloop-timer`.

## Dependencies ##

cl-czmq requires libzmq, libczmq, cffi and bordeaux-threads.

- ZMQ dependencies are available through zeromq.org.

- Lisp dependencies are available through
  [quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org).
